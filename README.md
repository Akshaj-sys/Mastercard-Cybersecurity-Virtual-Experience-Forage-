# Mastercard-Cybersecurity-Virtual-Experience-Forage

##  Overview
This repository documents my completion of the Mastercard Cybersecurity Virtual Experience Program on Forage.  
The simulation focused on understanding phishing attacks, analyzing employee susceptibility, and creating targeted security awareness training based on simulated attack results.

**Key skills demonstrated:**
- Phishing analysis
- Social engineering awareness
- Risk-based decision making
- Security awareness & communication


##  Simulation Objectives
- Identify red flags in phishing emails
- Understand how attackers improve phishing credibility
- Analyze phishing simulation data across departments
- Design effective, targeted employee awareness training


##  Task 1: Phishing Email Analysis & Creation

###  Initial Phishing Email Review
The simulation began with analyzing a phishing email impersonating Mastercard IT, designed to pressure employees into resetting their passwords.

**Notable characteristics:**
- Urgent subject line
- Password reset request
- External sender domain (Gmail)
- Embedded link directing users off-site


###  Knowledge Check – Quiz Questions

#### Q1: What is the first issue spotted in the phishing email?
**Correct Answer:** Suspicious looking source email address  

**Explanation:**
- The sender used a Gmail address instead of an official Mastercard domain  
- There was a subtle typo in the sender name


#### Q2: How could the phishing email be improved to appear more believable?
**Correct Answer:** Improve spelling, grammar & sloppy layout  

**Explanation:**
- Professional attackers focus heavily on formatting and language
- Poor grammar and layout reduce credibility


###  Phishing Email Draft
Using the insights from the quiz, I drafted a more realistic phishing email to understand how attackers:
- Improve presentation
- Create urgency
- Mimic internal IT communications

 *This task was performed strictly for educational and defensive purposes.*


##  Task 2: Phishing Simulation Results Analysis

###  Department-wise Results

| Team          | Email Open Rate | Click-through Rate | Phishing Success Rate |
|---------------|-----------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| IT            | 80%             | 2%                 | 0%                    |
| HR            | 100%            | 85%                | 75%                   |
| Card Services | 60%             | 50%                | 10%                   |
| Reception     | 40%             | 10%                | 0%                    |
| Engineering   | 70%             | 4%                 | 1%                    |
| Marketing     | 65%             | 40%                | 38%                   |
| R&D           | 50%             | 5%                 | 2%                    |
| **Overall Avg** | **66%**       | **28%**            | **18%**               |



###  Knowledge Check – Risk Identification

#### Q1: Which teams performed poorly in the phishing simulation? 
**Correct Answer:** HR and Marketing teams  

**Reasoning:**
- Highest click-through rates
- Highest credential submission rates
- Greater exposure to sensitive data


##  Task 3: Security Awareness Training Presentation

###  Objective
Create a 3–5 slide security awareness presentation targeted specifically at:
- **HR Department**
- **Marketing Department**

The training was designed to be:
- Clear and concise
- Easy to understand
- Non-technical
- Engaging for employees


###  Training Topics Covered
- What is phishing?
- Common phishing tactics
- Vishing (voice phishing)
- Whaling (executive-targeted phishing)
- How employees can prevent phishing attacks


###  Key Learning
While my presentation focused on clarity and accuracy, Mastercard’s reference solution emphasized:
- Visual storytelling
- Diagrams over text
- Minimal bullet points

**Key takeaway:**
 Effective cybersecurity awareness training relies on visual, scenario-based communication that employees can easily remember.


##  Final Takeaways
- Phishing attacks exploit human behavior, not just technical vulnerabilities
- Different departments face different phishing risks
- Targeted training is more effective than generic awareness programs
- Visual communication improves learning retention
